771067,1,We're Coming to Get You!,"The Embarrassing Illnesses doctors have decided to up sticks and take their clinic on the road! In the first of four special programmes, the three straight-talking doctors – Christian Jessen, Dawn Harper and Pixie McKenna – begin their tour of Britain in the city of Leeds, with a PR offensive that Victoria Beckham would be proud of. And to ensure that no fungal feet, problem penises or bothersome boils slip through the net, the EI team have chosen a location bang in the heart of Leeds, on Briggate – one of the city’s busiest shopping streets. With the high street transformed into a slalom of stalls, information boards and games, there will be nowhere for the people of Leeds to hide. The doctors are back…and the time for excuses is over! Kicking off proceedings is Kali, who has embarrassment written all over her face. She’s suffering from a common inflammatory condition of the skin called Rosacea, which causes redness that looks like a flush or blush.",,44103
771065,2,Breasts,"In this second of four specials, the Embarrassing Illnesses doctors will be concerning themselves with breasts and all matters mammary. In an effort to encourage women to bring their breasts out into the open, they’ll be taking their medical expertise to the capital and setting up drop-in clinics in the East End and West End of London – in the imposing surroundings of Shoreditch town hall, and conveniently, in a bra shop in the heart of Covent Garden. First through the clinic’s doors is a huge pair of double ‘J’ breasts, swiftly followed by 40-year-old Alyson. After 20-years of back pain and misery from carrying around a whopping 5 kilos on her chest, she is desperate to see if Dr Harper can reduce her burden by referring her for breast reduction surgery. Former breast cancer sufferer, Cheryl, whose breast removal and problematic reconstructive surgery left her with only one breast, also visits the clinic to see Dr Jessen.",,44103
771069,3,Vaginas,"The penultimate programme in our week of specials sees the EI team rolling into Norwich to set up a clinic in the heart of one of the country’s busiest shopping centres. This time the Docs are getting stuck into the Vagina, and there’s no room for coyness ladies!

The first patients in the EI clinic are a group of teenagers who want to find out more about the embarrassing consequences of thrush. 75% of women get thrush at some point in their lives, and it affects everybody – from babies to grannies and a few fellas on the way through. 

Then there’s 42-year-old Debbie, who’s come to see the Doctors after giving birth to a bouncing baby boy. Baby Samuel’s doing fine, but Debbie’s having to deal with the embarrassing consequences of a painful childbirth that delivered much more than just a bundle of joy…

The Docs are next putting periods under their medical microscopes, looking at the causes of period pain as well as the painful condition Endometriosis, where cells from the womb find their way into different parts of the body, with unpleasant consequences.

We’re then reacquainted with 45-year-old Alyson from Monday’s programme, who’s all in a flap when it comes to exposing herself to her new partner. Fortunately, a consultation with Dr Pixie leads to a welcome resolution to her elongated labia.

The menopause is something that every woman must eventually go through. However, the period just before that, the perimenopause, is less understood, but can be taste of things to come. With hot flushes, night sweats and weight gain among the symptoms, Dr Dawn discusses some of the treatment options, including Hormone Replacement Therapy. 

There’s also a case of vaginal dryness for Dr Dawn to examine as well, with a novel treatment involving a vaginal oestrogen pessary. Thanks to the treatment, Susan and her husband can resume normal service in the bedroom.

Back in their London clinic, the Docs have a case of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, which affects over a third of British women, including high profile sufferers like Emma Thompson and Victoria Beckham. Jenni’s in the clinic to be rid of the hair that’s constantly appearing on her back and chest, and a course of laser treatment sees her much improved. They also have a woman whose overactive bladder is making her life a misery, but there’s a novel solution more commonly associated with the world of cosmetic surgery…

Dr Dawn makes a house call on a women whose been suffering from a prolapsed rectum for years, and fortunately there’s a solution to her plight – but it’s certainly not for the faint hearted…

Finally, Dr Jessen is running a smear campaign in Norwich! He’s targeting the 20% of British women that don’t attend a regular cervical smear test. And he’s not taking no for an answer…as three volunteers discover when he persuades them to have theirs done there and then!

771066,4,Men,"Having waged war on the Vagina yesterday, the EI Docs turn their attention to the GP surgery’s most elusive creature – the ‘MAN’. From baldness to man boobs, and troublesome testicles to problem penises, the Docs are hitting the streets of Gloucester, searching for men who are in desperate need of a health MOT…

In the climax to our week of specials, the Embarrassing Bodies clinic sets up camp at Gloucester Rugby Club. And it’s not long before they’ve got their first eye-watering case: a man whose manhood has been mangled by a piercing. Fortunately, Dr Harper is on hand to give some advice on how to keep it clean, before she heads out to a local pub to quiz the locals on how much they know about their health – with predictably poor results…

Back at the club, the next patient who appears is suffering from the classic symptoms of an enlarged prostate. With 1 in 4 men over the age of 60 suffering in this way, Dr Jessen heads out to talk to pathologist Dr Jarmulowicz about how it affects men, and why so few know about it.

This is all brought into sharp focus by 53-year-old Barry, who was struck down by Prostate Cancer 3 years ago. With his symptoms worsening, Barry comes along to the clinic to see Dr Jessen about the options open to him, including surgical removal, which carries with it the risks of incontinence and impotence.

Most men would like to laugh off their illnesses, but the Docs have discovered that going bald can be no laughing matter. They’ve brought four balding blokes together to test out the latest hair loss products, including light technology; natural trichology, minoxydil lotion and even a full 6-hour hair transplant operation!

Dr Jessen also gets to grips with a case of gynecomastia (man-boobs to most of us), when we catch up with 33-year-old Abdul from Tuesday’s programme, who’s looking to put 17 years of discomfort behind him. After a two hour operation (and the removal of three pints of fat!) Abdul’s very happy to show off his manly new chest.

With surgery nearly over, Christopher drops in with a problem penis. The Docs decide that a chemically induced erection is the only way to find out if the problem will require a circumcision…

As last orders are called at the Embarrassing Bodies bar, there’s a final patient to be seen. John’s acne had given his confidence a massive knock – but with the aid of dermatologist Dr Chopra, John was able to avoid plastic surgery and get on the road to recovery.

771089,1,Pelvic Floor,"Dr Christian Jessen and Dr Pixie McKenna – the nation’s favourite doctors for those toes curling embarrassing conditions are back – and now they’re joined by A&E Doctor, Dr Priya Manickavasagar and leading cosmetic Dentist, Dr James Russell – between them they’ve got every orifice covered. 

This week’s episode starts with a visit to the clinic for 21-year-old Rebecca. She’s always had noticeably asymmetric breasts (in common with many women in the UK) but pregnancy has accentuated this problem and left her with a severe imbalance. Dr Pixie sends Rebecca to a specialist to see if anything can be done to rectify the problem. The specialist performs a surgical procedure to give Rebecca more balanced and symmetrical breasts.

Next through the clinic doors is Mark, who’s firing on all cylinders – but unfortunately he’s firing blanks. As a long-term diabetic, Dr Christian suspects this might be connected with his erectile problems, but first sends him for a check-up on his prostate. Tests reveal that damage to nerves is causing a condition called retrograde ejaculation, where the semen is entering his bladder instead of leaving through the end of the penis.

In our truck stop Dr Christian sees a case of neuroma, an overgrowth of nerve tissue that is benign, but can be removed surgically if necessary, whilst Dr Pixie sees a patient who is suffering from keloid scars, which are sadly too far developed to be treated effectively. There’s also a case of a birthmark on the tongue, and an instance of melasma that has lead to an overgrowth of pigment on the patients face. Pixie recommends make-up to start with, before considering lazer treatment in the future.

Dr Christian next sees a young lady suffering from one of the most common conditions that Doctors see – warts. Luckily Christian is able to freeze the warts off in the surgery, and with some home treatments she should be able to keep them under control herself.

Our Dentist Dr James has a visit from a patient with an artistic streak, but her teeth are anything but picture perfect. Heavily decayed, her teeth need to be crowned and reshapen if she’s to recover her sparkle. After removing the decay and creating custom veneers, Dr James gives his patient a reason to smile again.

Next up is Brigitte who’s comes to see Dr Pixie with a big problem. She thinks that she has an excessively large vagina that has remained even though she has lost a substantial amount of weight. Dr Pixie examines Brigitte and diagnoses her with a vaginal prolapse and excess skin around the vagina. After a visit to a specialist, Brigitte is told that there is no quick surgical fix for her problems and further examinations must be done.

The doctors hit the streets of Birmingham to talk to locals about the perils of weak pelvic floor muscles and recommend exercises and remedies to regain control over these important muscle areas. The doctors persuade a group of 3 women to road test 3 different techniques for strengthening their Pelvic Floors – with some surprising results. The products tested included a Pelvic Toner, a Pelvic Floor Exerciser and Pelvic Cones.

Dr Priya meets her first patient, Peter, who’s suffering from urinary incontinence after the removal of his prostate due to cancer. He’s been wearing pads and taking medication to control the symptoms, but nothing seems to be effective. Dr Priya sends him to a specialist where the consultant inserts a pump to give Peter control of his bladder with the push of a button.

This week’s body check sees our guinea pig group checking their feet for early signs of an embarrassing illness, whilst Dr Pixie and Dr Priya talk to them about what they can do about athlete’s foot, corns and flat feet.

And finally, the doctors put their own bodies on the line to take the fear out of simple tests. This week, Dr Pixie undergoes the latest test for HIV that reveals results instantly.",,44105
771091,2,Kids,"This week’s episode starts with 8-year-old Charlotte from Suffolk who’s been suffering from sore verrucas on her feet for over 2 years. Dr Christian sends Charlotte for tests to check her immune system and try and find out why the virus is winning. 

The tests reveal that her immune system is unable to fight the virus and so the usual treatment for verrucas will not do the job. Whilst a formaldehyde treatment produces some encouraging results, further immunology test reveal that she’s missing certain lymphocytes and the possible treatment course includes a bone marrow transplant and chemotherapy. 

+++UPDATE+++

Charlotte’s operation to remove the verrucas from her foot appears to have been successful and her foot is healing really well. She’s back on her bike and back to being a normal child, pending a potential bone marrow transplant.

The EB bus heads to Southend, where Dr Priya has a patient with case of cold feet, medically known as Chilblains. Dr Pixie’s patient can’t stop scratching her itchy sores while Dr Christian has a customer with a permanent runny nose due to nasal polyps.

Next up is a visit to the dentist for 27-year-old Lyn from Aberdeen. Lyn arrived to see Dr James because she has an addiction to fizzy drinks that has left her with missing, rotting and discoloured teeth. After extracting the rotten teeth, Dr James recommends implants, but only if Lyn will give up smoking, as it drastically reduces the success rate of the procedure. After a long day in the dental hot seat, Lyn has a new set of pearly whites.

Visiting the clinic next is David, 24, from Shropshire who’s had an embarrassing swelling for more than half his life. None of the treatments and tests have been able to ease his enlarged sore lips. Dr Pixie suggests that the swelling is a possible sign of an allergic reaction. Tests reveal that David is allergic to cinnamon and a long list of preservatives; so he sets off in search of a new diet. 

The doctors head to a very windy Southend-on-Sea to meet with a group of kids and their parents at Fairways primary school. Dr Pixie talks to the kids about head lice and shows them up close just how nasty they can be, whilst Dr James teaches the kids a lesson about tooth decay.

Read Dr James’ guide to How to Look After Your Teeth >

Maria, 13, believed she had a case of head lice, but it turned out to be much more serious. Maria actually has scalp psoriasis that causes her scalp to scale and nothing she’s tried has helped. Dr Pixie sends Maria to a hair specialist to get the scaling and inflammation under control with the help of creams and steamers. After three visits to the hair specialist Maria comes back to the clinic and shows Dr Pixie her much improved scalp.

Ever since 43-year-old Sandra from Derby gave birth she’s developed a rather messy problem. Sandra experiences problems with her bottom – it bleeds and causes problems for her hygiene. Dr Pixie diagnoses Sandra with skin tags and sends her to a specialist to try a surgical procedure to clear up her problem. Tests show Sandra’s problem goes deeper than just the skin tags – she’s suffering from a case of rectacil, where her bowel is misshapen. Sandra will have to complete more tests, but pelvic floor exercises have been recommended to help her cause.",,44105
771090,3,Rural,"First through the door this week is 18-year-old Cherie who’s suffering from back pain caused by extremely large breasts. The best option to ease the discomfort caused by her gigantic 30JJ bust is breast reduction and Dr Pixie refers Cherie to a specialist surgeon to get the procedure done. 

Visiting the dental clinic is Richard, 27, who has painful, aching teeth. Dr James’ examination reveals that Richard’s teeth are worn down as a result of Bruxism, an involuntary grinding of the teeth. Richard is sent to a specialist to clear the decay in his gums and teeth before Dr James can restore his smile with veneers and crowns.

Read Dr James’ guide to How to Look After Your Teeth >

Next in is Vicky, 28, who’s been dealing with boils in her groin area. Dr Christian believes the boils are caused by a condition in the sweat glands called Hidradenitis Suppurativa. As Vicky’s case is fairly mild, Dr Christian recommends treatment with antibiotics, the contraceptive pill, or acne treatments as opposed to more invasive surgery.

The EB Bus heads out on the road, and first in is Amanda who feels that she has very large labia – but Dr Pixie’s examination reveals she’s perfectly normal. Meanwhile, Sharon shows her severe skin condition to Dr Christian who sends her to a dermatologist for a more accurate diagnosis. The specialist seeing Sharon prescribes topical creams to treat her scaly skin that’s been badly sun damaged.

Julie visits the clinic because her ear is flaking skin and secreting gunky liquid. Dr Priya believes July has chronic otitis externa, an infection and inflammation of the ear, and sends in some sample swabs to be analyzed. An Ear Nose and Throat specialist injects an ointment into Julie’s ears and clears up her infection.

Next in the clinic to see Dr Christian is Sarah who’s been suffering from lumps around her eyes for years. The condition is known as xanthelasma and it causes fatty growths around the eyes. Dr Christian recommends that she try make-up to start with as other methods carry the risk of scarring around the eyes.

Allison, 23, is suffering from a funnel chest, a common hereditary condition where the chest is sunken. Because funnel chest can affect cardio and respiratory functions, Allison is sent to see a specialist for a check-up. After positive results from her test, the specialist attempts to re-contour Allison’s chest with a cosmetic filler.

The EB doctors head out to rural Staffordshire to meet with the locals and discuss their health. Dr Christian speaks with some young farmers about the perils of STIs whilst Dr Pixie gets people talking about their bowels.

And finally, this week’s body check sees our guinea pig group checking their poo for signs of ill health. Dr Christian talks to them about the reasons behind the differing colours and what different shapes and consistencies can indicate.",,44105
771092,4,Feet,"This week’s episode starts with a visit to the clinic for Natalie, a 31-year-old woman who has had to endure taunts from children about the boils and cysts that she has suffered since childhood. Dr Pixie suspects she is suffering from painful cystic acne, and sends her to a specialist for treatment with antibiotics and lazer resurfacing. On returning to the clinic, Natalie has been prescribed the contraceptive pill and some small skin grafts that drastically improve the appearance of her condition.

The EB bus heads to Merseyside, where Dr Christian sees a case of a pierced problem nipple, whilst Dr Pixie sees a case of dermatitis that has it’s sufferer scratching himself in a very sensitive area. Meanwhile Christian puts a hydrocele sufferers mind at ease.

Dr James meets Thomas, whose mouthful of manky molars has left him with a smile that would worry a 70-year-old, but he’s only 20! Dr James recommends implants, but Thomas’s smoking substantially reduces the success rate, so dentures are going to have to be tried first.

The docs hit the streets of Liverpool to talk about feet, helped out by local podiatric surgeon Emma Supple, with some cases of calloused corns and nail psoriasis on display. The docs also hit the streets of Merseyside to see if they can persuade the ladies of Liverpool to give high heals the heave ho…

Next in the clinic is Anna, who has come in with a swollen arm and leg that Dr Christian diagnoses as Lymphodema. After visiting a specialist clinic, Anna starts a course of treatment involving manually massaging the excess fluid out of the swollen limbs.

Dr Pixie sees a young woman called Emma who is suffering from a hernia and excess skin after two pregnancies. Dr Pixie sends her off to a surgeon for repair to her umbilical hernia, and removal of the excess skin.

Next up, Dr Priya sees an unusual case of an abscess just above a man’s bottom, called a Pilonidal Sinus. The amount of hair in the area seems to be to blame, with hair filling up a pit in the skin and causing an infection to develop. The first treatment used is a lazer to remove the problem causing hair, followed by a surgical procedure to remove the infected follicles, which is full of matted hair.

And finally, this week’s body check sees our guinea pig group checking their urine for signs of ill health. Dr Christian talks to them about the reasons behind the differing colours and what the warning signs are to look out for. You can take the urine test yourself here >>",,44105
771093,5,Holiday,"This week the doctors have set up shop at the airport. First patient Joanne, an air-hostess, feels that her psoriasis is alienating her passengers. Dr Pixie sees Donna, who has a patchy rash on her back that is diagnosed as shingles and Dr Christian deals with Arthur who has a disfigured fingernail due to an accident at work. The doctors also check random samples from passengers to test for bacteria and bugs that have travelled with them.

Back at the clinic, 44-year-old Stuart thinks that his holiday is responsible for the constant burning at the end of his penis. Dr Pixie believes an inflammation of the prostate, caused by a possible bladder infection, may well be the reason for Stuart’s troubles. He’s sent for a visit to a specialist and a treatment involving a prostate massage…

After the birth of her child a year ago, Kerry has begun to feel pain and bleeding with her bowel movements – and visits to the loo are few and far between. Dr Christian notes that Kerry has developed a skin tag due to a tear and sends her to a specialist. Further testing doesn’t reveal anything sinister in her bowels and the problem is pinpointed as a tense pelvic muscle.

Next up is Lindsay who has had a scar on her chest since she was 7 years old. Lindsay has developed a keloid scar, possibly from a pimple or bug bite, and Dr Pixie recommends steroid injections followed with laser treatment to help flatten out the surface of the scar.

In to meet Dr James is Jessica, who has suffered from bad breath for years. Jessica has been blaming her halitosis on her tongue, but Dr James reveals it has more to do with gum disease. Jessica’s inflamed gums have created pockets that help to house bacteria and plaque, a visit to the dental hygienist helps to clear up the blockage and reduce her bad breath.

Back at the airport, Brendan has a spotty abdomen caused by “folliculitis”/conditions/folliculitis/ whilst a returning passenger has been bitten by bed bugs on his holiday. Dr Pixie also sees Helene who has some moles on her back that are hurting…

This week’s body check sees our guinea pig group checking their moles for signs of changes and abnormalities. Doctors Christian and Priya explain what to look out for to avoid dangerous deadly moles.

Caroline, 25, has hidden her hair loss problem for over 10 years. She’s been losing hair in patches that take up to a year to grow back. Caroline has a condition called Alopecia, and Dr Christian gives her the unfortunate news that there is no known cure for her problem. Possible treatments to control the hair loss are steroids or topical creams that stimulate hair growth.

And finally this week, Dr Pixie and Dr Christian put their bodies on the line to show how easy it is to do body checks. This time around, they are checking their urine for any signs of abnormalities and ill health.",,44105
771094,6,Erectile Dysfunction,"This week’s episode starts with a visit to the clinic for former RAF airman Richard, whose case of gynaecomastia has left him with no body confidence and feeling repulsed when he looks in the mirror. After 26 years of suffering, Dr Pixie decided to send Richard for surgery to get rid of them once and for all.

Next into the Doctors’ mobile clinic is 16-year-old Wendy, who after recently giving birth has been left with severe stretch marks on her tummy. Vitamin E creams and Bio Oil are recommended by Dr Pixie as a way of reducing the marks that will also fade over time. A case of excessive sweating has left one woman feeling extremely embarrassed, but Dr Christian reassures her that there are multiple treatments available for this common condition.

EB Dentist Dr James Russell has a case in his surgery involving bulimia sufferer Harriet. Self-induced vomiting has left her with acid erosion on her teeth, shortening and eating away at the enamel. Porcelain veneers can be used to extend and protect her remaining teeth, but Harriet decided to wait before proceeding with the full treatment.

18-year-old student Clare has come to the clinic with some problem bowels that mean that she can go a week without passing a stool, but this is swiftly followed by excessive diarrhoea and stomach cramps. Dr Pixie excludes the possibility of haemorrhoids, but decides to send a stool sample of to be analysed. Having eliminated all other possibilities, Dr Pixie makes a diagnosis of IBS.

Next through the clinic doors is Alan, who has been battling with erectile dysfunction for nearly 10 years. Dr Christian recommends that Alan starts by losing some of his excess weight, before he is sent off to a specialist to check out the problem. The specialist recommends a number of possible non-surgical treatments, including a penis pump.

Dr Pixie sees a patient with an enlarged stomach whose GP has already eliminated a number of potential conditions. Despite losing weight Stuart still has a large belly, and so is sent for an ultrasound scan. The results of the scan are inconclusive, suggesting that dietary and lifestyle changes are the best course of action.

Dr Dawn suggest a course of photopneumatic therapy, where a lazer and a vacuum are used to loosen and extract dirt and excess oil from the skin. Following three courses of treatment, Marissa was feeling a lot happier.

Many people think that sunbathing is a cure for acne, but too much sun can be extremely dangerous, and in our Teenage Bodies series we investigated a growing problem of ‘tanorexia’ which had led 16-year-old Sammy Jo to spend far too much time on the sunbeds. On a revisit to the clinic, Sammy Jo has revealed her addiction has now switched to the bottle – but fortunately it’s a bottle of spray tan.

26 year-old David came to the clinic with a massive amount of excess skin that was leftover from his overweight teenage years. David underwent surgery to remove his man boobs, and the results have left him with not only a flat chest, but a new lease of life. After the success of this operation, David is considering the next stage of removal of his excess stomach skin as well…

And finally there was Charlotte, who at only 19 was suffering from an extreme case of excessive sweating. With other treatments not working, Charlotte was sent for a painful series of botox injections. 6-months on, the initial treatment has worn off, leaving Charlotte with a return trip to the clinic.

771096,8,Oral,"First up, is 26-year-old David whose rotting, bleeding, puss-filled armpit has left him unable to lift up his arm without tearing the skin. The problem is diagnosed as Hidradenitis Suppurativa, a condition in which the sweat glands are blocked up, infected and develop into boils. Dr Christian sends a swab sample for analysis to reveal the bacteria infecting David, in order to prescribe the appropriate antibiotics. In the meantime, David is told to take steroids to help contain the symptoms and has been referred to a surgeon to see what can be done about the damaged skin.

Visiting the clinic next is Stacy, who has a problem with piles. Dr Priya examines Stacy and discovers that she’s also suffering from skin tags. As other treatments have thus far failed, Dr Priya suggests a visit to the surgeon to have both the skin tags and the piles removed. There is also a visit from Allison, a newlywed from Lancashire who is experiencing pain during sex. Dr Pixie’s examination doesn’t reveal anything sinister with Allison’s body and so she recommends psycho-sexual counselling to try and get to the root of Allison’s problem.

Next up we see 24-year-old Holly who has come to see Dr Pixie about her sweaty palms. As botox injections are ineffective for palmar hyperhidrosis, a procedure utilizing electric currents is suggested. Holly’s iontophorisis treatments show significant improvements and the good news is that she can get a machine at home to continue with these treatments on a permanent basis.

771097,9,Rally,"The doctors are back in the clinic to check-up on some of the most interesting cases that they’ve encountered over the past 2 years.

Dr Dawn asks Scotsman John back to the clinic to update her on progress with his treatment for the disfiguring condition Acne Keloidalis. It had left John with painful nodules on the back of his head and some severe scarring, forcing him to not go out in public without a baseball cap. Thanks to some extensive treatment from Consultant Dermatologist Dr Sunil Chopra, John’s condition has improved beyond all recognition, leaving him with a full head of hair and brimming with confidence.

Confidence, or lack of it, was what drove 16-year old Nathan to visit the EB clinic with some severe pubescent acne. With home treatments not proving effective, Dr Dawn referred Nathan for hydra-dermabrasion, a procedure that removes impurities and lessens the scarring caused by acne. Following treatment Nathan’s acne: has improved dramatically, ensuring that he can hopefully avoid the painful physical and emotional scarring that it can cause, something that another of Dawn’s patient, Haileigh, knows about only too well.

Haileigh has suffered with severe acne for 28 years and it has left her with deep, pitted scars all over her face. After over a year of intensive skin treatment, including lazer resurfacing and dermal injections, Haileigh is showing considerable signs of improvement.

A patient whose life has been totally changed by her treatment by the Embarrassing Bodies Doctors was Dionne, who arrived in the clinic with a mystery skin condition that numerous specialists had failed to diagnose. Dr Harper suspected that it was a condition called Ichthyosis, where her skin was becoming dry, scaly and cracked. Having treated her condition with a prepared solution of Cetraben, Culmurid & Eucerin, combined with wrapping in cling film, Dionne is problem free and only occasionally has to repeat the treatment to prevent future flare-ups.

Dr Christian also catches up with Anna, who came to the clinic with extremely deflated breasts following her pregnancy. With her confidence low Dr Christian sent her for a consultation with a cosmetic surgeon to discuss a breast augmentation operation. Having decided to go ahead with the surgery, Anna returns to the clinic to report that her confidence has skyrocketed since the operation, making the extensive surgical risks worthwhile on this occasion. 

Another patient who’s back in the clinic is Pamela, who came to see Dr Christian with stress incontinence, a very common problem that affects millions of women in the UK. Pamela’s case was extremely severe, so Dr Christian recommended a botox treatment that would treat, though not cure, her overactive bladder. Having successfully undergone the treatment, Pamela returns to let Christian know how she’s been getting on, and though the results were not permanent, she has seen a massive improvement.

34-year old Sophia came to the clinic with a skin condition that Dr Pixie diagnosed as hyper-pigmentation caused by excessive hair growth. Having undergone lazer treatment and glycolic peeling, Sophia returns to the clinic to show a marked improvement in the colour and severity of her condition.

Finally, Dr Christian sees a patient who decided to undergo a testicle implant operation to balance out his balls after losing one of them to testicular cancer, and also caught up with 13-year old Anthony, who was suffering with gynaecomastia, brought on by puberty and some excess weight.

771098,11,Back to the Clinic 3,"The doctors are back in the clinic to check-up on some of the most interesting cases that they’ve encountered over the past 2 years.

First up is a visit from fifty year old Jackie, who was suffering from one of the commonest problems seen by GPs – urinary incontinence. A staggering one in five women over the age of 40 will suffer from the condition. Fortunately there was a simple solution to Jackie’s problem, as tension free vaginal tape was added to support the bladder and replace the muscle that she has lost as she got older.

The doctors also caught up with 72-year-old Bryan, who had been suffering for over 10 years with a painful problem with his penis, a direct result of a circumcision that hadn’t gone to plan. Bryan is packed off by Dr Christian to have a second circumcision carried out, and returns to the clinic two years later to check that Bryan is still firing on all cylinders following the opp.

Dr Dawn next sees a patient whose life was literally torn apart by the birth of her baby boy. Debbie’s vagina was so badly torn during the birth, that the muscles around her bladder and rectum were causing her to leak urine and faeces. After a massive reconstruction operation, Debbie returns to see Dr Dawn, who is delighted to see that she is feeling just like a young mum again.

Our next patient is Rachel, who has suffered from plaque psoriasis for over 11 years. Rachel’s skin cells were reproducing every 2-6 days, which compared alarmingly to a normal person’s rate of every 3-4 weeks. Christian sent Rachel for ultraviolet light therapy, which even after a few treatments was starting to show positive signs. Returning 18-months on, Rachel’s skin is vastly improved and her life has completely changed.

Another patient who returns to the clinic was Martin, who has undertaken a course of cognitive behavioral therapy to help him to get over his fear of taking a pee in public. Fortunately Martin’s therapy has been a success, and he’s making fantastic progress.

Next there are visits from Dr Christian and Dr Dawn to the men of Moseley Rugby Club and a group of women who have shame in baring all. They’re shown how to self-check their balls and their boobs, and you can too by going to our How to Check Yourself guides >>

Boobs were a problem for Alison, who after 20 years of suffering awful back pain from her double J boobs, came to visit Dr Dawn to see if she could get something off her chest. After surgery that removed a kilo and a half of breast tissue, Allison returned to the surgery with a new lease of life.

Dr Dawn caught up with Adel, who came to the clinic with a condition called polycystic ovary syndrome. This has resulted in Adel developing excess hair on her face and body, so Dr Dawn sent her off for a course of lazer treatment. Eight months later, Adel is back in the clinic and showing a fantastic improvement. Though the hairs will continue to grow back, she now knows that she can keep the condition under control…

And our final patient also came into the clinic with a breast related problem, this time caused by an earlier breast reduction that had left her with artificially high nipples now that nature was taking it’s course. Flattening of the nipples was also a cause for concern for Dr Dawn, so Jacqui was sent for a mammogram to check their was nothing sinister afoot. Fortunately there wasn’t, and she was able to return to the clinic to show how a hydrolonic acid lift had been plump up the breasts and bring the nipples down back to where they belonged.",,44105

Keith’s got a rather sensitive penis complaint that he’s keen to sort out. Dr Christian soon diagnoses Peyronie’s disease. Realising the severity of this particular case Dr Christian sees surgery as the only option, and refers Keith on to a neurological surgeon who he hopes can straighten things out. Keith meets consultant urological surgeon Mr. Paul Anderson to discuss options. With advice from his surgeon Keith opts for a Nesbitt’s procedure which removes tissue from the unaffected side of the penis so that things balance out when sewn back up, even if slightly shorter. After a two-hour procedure Keith’s penis is corrected, with Dr Christian recommending that he waits a few months before seeking further treatment for his excess foreskin.",,44104

First in to see Dr Dawn was Summer who was being plagued by a thick build up of ear wax. After examination, Dr Dawn notes the excessive build up and advises that cotton buds may be making the situation worse by aggravating her ear canal. She advises a course of ear drops with possible ear syringing if needed.",,44104
771078,6,Belfast,"Kirstie, 21, dropped in to see Dr Dawn concerned about her inverted nipples which she’d been suffering with since puberty. Kirstie’s inverted nipples meant that she had been unable to breastfeed her baby and the thought of going through the same pain again was putting her off having more children. Dr Dawn sent her to see breast specialist Dr Yannis Alexandrides who advised a surgical procedure which would give Kirstie a 90% chance of being able to breast feed. Surgery was successful so Kirstie returned to the clinic to show Dr Dawn the vast improvement.",,44104
771079,7,Back to the Clinic,"Bridgid first came to see Dr Pixie in October 2008 with a large vagina caused by excess skin following dramatic weight loss. On examination Dr Pixie also diagnoses the signs of vaginal prolapse. These symptoms were having a severely negative effect on Bridgid’s life – even causing her husband to sleep in a different room. After consultation with specialist Dr Slack, Bridgid’s previous notion that a hysterectomy would fix her problem was proven to only solve part of her discomfort. After further discussion the decision to prescribe a series of injections relieved the symptoms dramatically, however they can only be taken temporarily. Bridget is still consulting her doctor in regards to the best long term treatment options available to her but was feeling far less discomfort and was much happier.",,44104
771080,8,Glasgow,"The first case for this episode was Ed, who dropped into the clinic to see Dr Christian about an embarrassing problem that was preventing him from having intercourse. Losing 18 stone and undergoing a tummy tuck had left Ed with a vast surplus of excess skin and fat in his groin, almost completely burying his penis and thus limiting his ability to function sexually. Dr Christian sent Ed to a surgeon for further discussions, and he advised a procedure that would lift the excess skin up, effectively freeing the shaft of Ed’s penis which was buried under the folds of excess skin. Having undergone the surgery Ed returned to show the marked improvement in his condition.",,44104
771081,9,Middlesbrough,"23 year old Claire came to the clinic to discuss her embarrassing problem with Dr Christian. She has a sore labia that has previously swelled up to four times its normal size, and Clare was desperate for some professional advice.

Cosmetic surgeon Dr Angelica Kavouni suggested surgery to remove the excess skin and reduce the labia in size. A few weeks later, with Clare rapidly recovering after the successful surgery, she returned to show Dr Christian the results.",,44104

Dr Christian diagnoses the condition as Hidradenitis Suppurativa, caused by blocked sweat glands. Having already tried antibiotics without success, Dr Christian prescribes a temporary treatment of strong steroids, although these do improve the condition they are not a long term solution and David is sent to see a plastic surgeon. At St John’s Hospital in Livingston, David is given a skin graft which completely removes the infected skin and replaces with layers of healthy skin taken from David’s thigh. We revisit a relieved David four months after his surgery to see the condition completely cured.

Enter Dr Dawn, who takes a swab from his leg and predicts that hospital treatment will be needed. Professor Val Edwards-Jones identifies the staphylococcal aureas organism in her analysis of the sample. While this explains the smelly discharge from Russell’s leg, he is referred to an immunologist to try and establish the cause of the problem. Russell sees an immunologist and a dermatologist, who determine that pyoderma gangrenosum syndrome is responsible for his leg ulceration. Immune cells have been attacking Russell’s skin and the condition has been complicated by his poor immune system being unable to deal with the added bacterial infection. Russell is told that there are probably only around 30 people in the world who have had this problem. He goes into hospital for two weeks, followed by six months of injecting antibiotics at home.",,44107

771111,10,Back To The Clinic,"When Maria first came visited the clinic in 2009 she was very embarrassed about the excess hair she had developed on her face and back. However, this was not just a physical problem for Maria, as this embarrassing hair growth has caused her problems at school and had severely knocked her confidence. After Dr Pixie referred Maria to a specialist, she found out that she had polycystic ovary syndrome, a condition that needs to be controlled with medication for life. Thankful that the cause had finally been identified, Maria was still anxious to have her hair removed as quickly as possible whilst waiting for her treatment to take effect. She was treated with a series of laser treatments to remove the hair and to stop it from growing back, and over a year later the results are amazing. She is now a lot more confident and now feels she can talk to people without feeling embarrassed.

5% of men are more likely to check symptoms that are worrying them on the internet, than they are going to their GP. Thankfully, Ed put aside his embarrassment to see Dr Christian at the clinic with his penis problem. After losing 19 and a half stone in weight, Ed had been suffering from a buried penis which made having sex and going to the loo very problematic. After seeing a surgeon, Ed had the excess skin removed from around his penis and 6 months later, he is visiting Dr Christian to give him an update on his condition. Ed is very happy with the results, and his confidence has 100% improved. But Ed is still having problems with his penis after his operation which he would like sorted out. Ed is having problems when he has an erection due to the tight skin around his penis. Dr Christian identifies the cause of this as the scarring Ed has from his previous tummy tuck which has caused the skin to tighten. Dr Christian advises more surgery to address this problem, but stresses that although this is a routine procedure there are always risks involved with any operation, so any decision has to be thought through carefully. 

To help women get their breast troubles off their chest, Dr Dawn and Dr Pixie set up a special breast awareness mobile clinic. Leah visited the clinic about the discharge and pain in her breast and although Dr Pixie said this blockage was not cancerous, Leah was absolutely right to get it checked out. Breast cancer comes in many forms with the symptoms varying from woman to woman. The main symptoms of breast cancer are lumps, orange peel skin and inverted nipples but any changes in your breast should be looked at. 1 in 8 women are likely to develop breast cancer, and these figures are on the rise so it is important to self check regularly and go to your doctor early if you have any concerns

Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer in men in the UK. When Richard came to see Dr Christian he had just been diagnosed. After having a case of prostatitis, Richard’s doctors found out that he had prostate cancer despite displaying no symptoms of the disease. A few weeks after seeing Dr Christian, Richard had key-hole surgery to remove his prostate and after the analysis on his prostate, he was told that his cancer has not grown outside the prostate. 15 months later, he visits Dr Christian again to tell him that he has been suffering from erectile dysfunction and incontinence after his surgery. But with this operation, it can take up to two years to fully recover, so with time and patience Richard should see an improvement in these symptoms.",,44107

With nothing untoward reported Dean had a similar procedure, this time with the camera inserted anally, followed by an ultrasound. It’s this final test that revealed the root of the problem.
