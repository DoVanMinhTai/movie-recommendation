The show took the form of a contest between two teams of 5 one all male the other all female to see who could run the most profitable bar in the Greek resort of Kavos. The winning team overall would win the takings of both bars. At the end of the week the losing team that week had to sack a team member in an open discussion.

The girls won the contest and controversially decided not to share the prize with the previously sacked members some of whom had worked longer than members of the final five.

The series was not a ratings success, the highlights show appearing progressively later in the schedules as it went on. It has not been revived though similarities in the format were obvious in ITV's The Club.",,,,0.0,0,0.0429,SERIES
