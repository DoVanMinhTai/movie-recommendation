643223,57,Camaro,"To resurrect a classic 1969 Chevrolet Camaro z28, restoration wizard Alan Lewenthal and his crew persist against the devastating effects of massive corrosion and the difficulties of finding authentic engine parts to restore this rare muscle car. They have just 12 weeks to complete the rebuild for a prestigious auto auction in Atlantic City where Alan hopes to sell the classic for a profit. Alan bought the Camaro sight unseen but information found on the z28s body tag made the rusty relic an irresistibly valuable restoration prospect. Along w/the standard designations for interior style and engine size, the tag indicated the former street racer had come from the GM factory with a custom color paint job. This z28 was a one-of-a-kindrare among the rare. Using auto-archaeology to find the original paint color and spending more than $100,000 in parts and labor, Alan raises this legendary muscle car from a rust heap to its former glory only to take a 40 thousand dollar loss at the Atlantic City auction. But he says, its all in the game.",,34724
